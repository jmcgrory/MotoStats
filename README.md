# MotoStats

## Notes

A personal development project exploring the latest features within Angular, RXJS, Typescript and other Front End technologies. This is a quick, non-production exercise, and will likely tie into a similar project which will provide a back end for this to communicate with.

## Stack

- **[Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli)** (7.0.1.)
- **[RxJS](https://rxjs-dev.firebaseapp.com/)** (6.3.3.)
- **[Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)** (3.1.1.)
- **Karma/Jasmine** (_subject to change_)

## Tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

**Notice**: It is likely I will be replacing Karma/Jasmine with Mocha/Chai

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Contributing

As this is a personal development project, I will not be accepting any contributions. If you have any advice or questions, please open an issue or get in contact directly and I will be happy to look into them.

If you wish to fork this project for personal use, please go ahead. If you wish to use this project for business purposes, please contact me first.
